# Manage Customer Data

(This project should be named Mange-Customer-Data. But now it's to late for that xD…)
This is an example of how you can manage customr data.

What you should know from the beginning is that the data in this example is saved in the code. In real life, you have to store your data in a Database. I use Entity Framework for that. But it’s up to you how you would store your data.

This example shows you also other interesting stuff. As an example: When you open a new window it automatically drops a shadow over your main window. This prevents the user from making something in your main window. Also, I have built in a custom MetroBox and a custom MetroBox with additional options! Check them out.
The next thing that I am very proud of is the search feature. I really don’t know if someone else would solve that problem the way I have done it, but I like it very much. The search feature searches in all columns and rows for your entered text and shows you the result right away. 
Every customer can have multiple addresses. This is the reason why I don’t display any street name or something else in the main window.
